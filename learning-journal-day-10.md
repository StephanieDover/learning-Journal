#Learning Journal Day 10

What I learned:  

More about CSS layout and positioning.  

The Chocolate pizza challenge was fun. I learned a lot about how to work with another developer when you're working on the same web page. It went surprisingly well. That was the first time I was given a design layout to copy and it's a lot easier than thinking it up on my own.
