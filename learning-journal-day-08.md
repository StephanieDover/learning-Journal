#Learning Journal Day 8  
leaning Journal  

What I've learned so far:  

DOM, OOP, forms. I've learned that changing the document with js is pretty simple and doesn't need to be overcomplicated (I'm sure I'll re-think that statement later on).

Thought of the day: coding is fun!!

I'm glad I finally have enough time to work on my CSS for Salmon Cookies.
