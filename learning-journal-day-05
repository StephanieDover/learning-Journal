JavaScript is getting easier and once you start to get then hang of it, it can be a lot of fun. So far the most fun part of learning js is solving challenge problems. I'm looking forward to learning more.

I LOVE CSS so reading more about CSS this week and having the opportunity to use it on my about me website was awesome !!
