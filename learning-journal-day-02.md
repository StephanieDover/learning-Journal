broke my git by trying to commit changes to github without adding a message. Freaked out. searched online for ways to fix it because :q! wasn't working. Freaked out some more when nothing online worked. Got the answer; I needed to rm files listed as .locked (.lock?) when I used ls -la .git.  
learned my lesson to always add a message.   

had fun putting together About Me webpage! CSS is awesome!
