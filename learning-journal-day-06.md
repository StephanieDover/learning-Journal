#Learning Journal Day 6  
leaning Journal  

What I've learned so far:  

how to properly write text and elements into a document using document.createElement(), document.getElementById(), document.createTextNode, and position.appendChild();  

Salmon cookies has been a huge challenge. The hardest part so far was figuring out how to set up the table correctly using js.  I'm learning a lot from this exercise and have thankfully been able to finish the labs each day so far.
