Learned more about how to use git and github. Learned how to clone directories created in github, how to add files to the directory using git, how to make changes to the files and then add, commit, push to sync the changes back into the github repository.    

broke my git by trying to commit changes to github without adding a message. Freaked out. searched online for ways to fix it because :q! wasn't working. Freaked out some more when nothing online worked. Got the answer; I needed to rm files listed as .locked (.lock?) when I used ls -la .git.  
learned my lesson to always add a message.   

had fun putting together About Me webpage! CSS is awesome!
