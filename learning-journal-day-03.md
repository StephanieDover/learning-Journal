# Learning Journal Day 3
learning-Journal  

what I learned today:

how to create a new branch for a repository in git and then push it back to github.  
running a loop through an array  


Notes:  

JavaScript is much more difficult than html and CSS. I need to spend a lot of time practicing with loops.  
it's getting easier to use git as I get more familiar with it. I'm excited about learning more about git, I had no experience with it until a week ago and I love learning new things.
