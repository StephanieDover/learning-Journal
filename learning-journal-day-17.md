#Learning Journal Day 17      
learning Journal  


I've found that one of the hardest parts of doing a group project is dealing with git merge issues. I've learned that there's a million ways to create merge issues in git and now I've been learning how to solve them.  

We made a lot of progress on Wine Fellows today and things are looking up for tomorrow. The hardest parts (theoretically) are done. Now it should be a lot easier to build the rest of our site.
